<!-- # iiwa_tool
Exemplary packages on how to extend [**iiwa_stack**](https://github.com/SalvoVirga/iiwa_stack) to use a KUKA LBR IIWA with a tool attached.

This packages are used within the [**wiki of iiwa_stack**](https://github.com/SalvoVirga/iiwa_stack/wiki) to explain some basic concepts of its usage.     
[**iiwa_stack**](https://github.com/SalvoVirga/iiwa_stack) needs to present on the system to make these packages work.

In brief, here is contained :
- **iiwa_tool_description** : a URDF for a KUKA LBR IIWA robot with a tool attached and a rigid base.
- **iiwa_tool_moveit** : a MoveIt! package to work with the robot description just defined.
- **iiwa_tool_examples** : small ROS nodes to show basic usage of the robot described above. -->
